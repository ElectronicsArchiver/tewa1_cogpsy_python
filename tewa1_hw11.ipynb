    "In this chapter, we have introduced the concept that perception is inherently probabilistic, and as\n",
    "such optimally characterized as a process of Bayesian inference. Regarding Bayesian inference, we\n",
    "have learned the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Conditional probabilities such as p(A | B) represents the probability of A given B. In Bayesian\n",
    "perceptual inference, A and B typically represent a world state and an observation.\n",
    "* The likelihood function, p(observation | world state), captures the information content of the\n",
    "sensory observation, relevant to distinguishing one world state from another.\n",
    "* The flatter the likelihood function, the less we learn from our senses. If the likelihood\n",
    "function is perfectly flat, then the observer has learned nothing from the observation.\n",
    "* In some cases, such as the “Is that my friend?” example, the likelihood changes over time.\n",
    "* The prior distribution over world states, p(world state), summarizes the information content\n",
    "of our past observations, the background knowledge we have about the world. Perception\n",
    "is not based entirely on sensory observation, but also on expectation grounded in previous\n",
    "experience.\n",
    "* Flatter prior distributions mean we know less about the potential states of the world.\n",
    "* Bayes’ rule calculates the posterior probability of each hypothesized world state, p(world state | observation),\n",
    "from the likelihoods and prior probabilities of the world states.\n",
    "* The procedures of Bayesian inference apply equally to situations in which the hypothesized\n",
    "world states are discrete or in which they are continuous.\n",
    "* Perceptual situations, whether in vision, audition, or other senses, are subject to various\n",
    "levels of uncertainty.\n",
    "* Speech perception is fraught with phonetic and syntactic ambiguity, frequently giving rise to\n",
    "flat likelihood functions. The combination of priors and likelihoods can cause misinterpreta-\n",
